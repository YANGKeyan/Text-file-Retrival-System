singapore since getting married moving new home husband ms noor hanisah noordin ha making effort reduce much meat eats charge cooking prepares vegetarian meal day week departure lived family almost every meal would meat reason change due changing taste preference desire healthier diet its environmental concern its important treat environment best way especially climate crisis indicates harming massively said yearold part singapore youth climate action much attention environmental damage done planet ha focused area use fossil fuel plastic food production consumption issue increasingly spotlight staple many peoples dinner table expert say red meat worst culprit causing environmental harm on relative scale producing certain amount red meat ha time greater impact environment producing amount plantbased foods said professor william chen director food science technology programme nanyang technological university ntu ms hanisahs journey eating le meat started browsed book prata stall jalan kayu highlighted food production consumption ha major impact environment it made lot sense food big part life said relationship food environment greenhouse gas emission food production make third global total study shown emission indicator used measure amount greenhouse gas released atmosphere due human activity gas cause greenhouse effect lead global heating warming lead issue like melting glacier rising sea level intensification extreme weather event prof chen also michael fam chair professor ntu cited figure show food production dominates environment instance per cent water used agriculture third crop land used produce animal feed related commentary whats singapores scorecard cop singapores farm face even greater challenge postcovid world focus climate change threaten food production singapore the food eat therefore closely related environment said food production ha impact associate professor l roman carrasco assistant head department biological sciences national university singapore nus said come environmental harm the worst far beef lamb their contribution climate change biodiversity loss staggering half emission food come animal product among half emission beef lamb said livestock farming ha worst carbon footprint sugarcane coffee among harmful crop environment production involve destroying biodiversity causing soil erosion prof chen said other surprise include rice paddy field emit greenhouse gas cereal well soybean farming said singapore perspective situation singapore somewhat different country reliant food import mean environmental cost bringing supply country ha comparatively greater impact singaporecentric study commissioned investment firm temasek carried agency science technology research astar deloitte looked environmental impact food item term greenhouse gas emission energy consumption water consumption study looked life cycle food time produced processed transported consumed study published wa commissioned provide insight situation many existing study centred united states europe consider environmental effect importing food found context singapore import per cent food transportation play important role contributing greenhouse gas emission compared many country food produced locally level consumption also made difference context pork ha bigger impact beef pork account greenhouse gas emission per annum per caput despite fact greenhouse gas emission one kilogram pork half one kilogram beef study found per caput consumption pork much greater beef study said according study annual greenhouse gas emission per caput basis carbon dioxide equivalent unit measurement chicken kg kg fish higher beef stood kg beef ha highest greenhouse gas emission per kg basis ha relatively low greenhouse gas emission per caput basis due low consumption study found per caput basis pork came top kg leafy vegetable like spinach lettuce chinese cabbage ranked lowest kg order reduce environmental impact key staple country origin proximity singapore becomes factor along transported greenhouse gas emission transportation stage food imported brazil time flying chilled meat shipping frozen sea freight study found adding similar comparison seen chilled frozen pork australia hence sourcing chilled food item neighbouring country producing locally serve meaningfully reduce environmental footprint mean avoiding need import food air transport study said study also said time per cent average singaporeans diet consists meat egg seafood study noted meat product pork significantly higher greenhouse gas fruit vegetable mean option reduce environmental impact food production consumption noting availability plantbased alternative meat singapore study said consuming le traditional meat plantbased meat could lead significant decrease greenhouse gas emission food supply due lower environmental footprint plant source much changing food habits help study come backdrop growing public awareness globally food production tied environmental damage discussion individual make difference ms hanisah ha reduced amount seafood chicken eats ms noor hanisah noordin ha making conscious effort take le meat seafood chicken photo noor hanisah noordin when come seafood youre sure theyre overfished theyre farmed dont want overtaking environment giving back said i think also seafood chicken add carbon footprintwise definitely resource need produce vegetables said changing food consumptionhabits would help environment tremendously assoc prof carrasco said for instance vegan food production emission would drop per cent said referring study done agency deloitte dr jonathan low astar said balanced diet substituting per cent animalbased red meat plantbased alternative could reduce food greenhouse gas emission per cent beyond individuals consumption farming need transform gradually moving away industrialised agriculture sustainable agriculture prof chen said key sustainability food production said adding change towards efficient agricultural system needed promoting sustainable livestock farming involves sustainable feed higher production yield better manure utilisation critical step forward said alternative food source may become increasingly important considering impact climate change traditional farming added restaurants individual part restaurant also taking step help protect environment mexicanturkish restaurant chain stuffd temporarily replaced beef plantbased alternative recent collaboration impossible foods make product price remain said chains regional business development manager jason tan stuffd started offering impossible beef menu price wa concern customer mr tan said conventional beef wa still

adding treatment decomposition food waste estimated contribute additional oneeighth global greenhouse gas emission file photo food waste photo afpjeanchristophe verhaegen similarly prof chen said one easiest change people introduce eating habit reduce food waste one way help save planet encourage responsible consumption consumer education said another way help develop alternative food source said urban farming provides viable option food source city said getting singaporeans involved communityscale urban farming also help raising awareness preciousness food thus naturally inculcate responsible consumption behaviour said decisions including kind food much people eat play major role health environment sustainability reason gradually moving toward intake healthier food certainly improve environmental sustainability said assoc prof carrasco referred reducing food waste lowest hanging fruit people make impact we need drastic impact best change represent major effort
