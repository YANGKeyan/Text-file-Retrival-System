SINGAPORE: Five Singaporeans, aged between 61 and 65, were arrested on Wednesday (Jan 5) for suspected drug trafficking activities, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) said on Thursday. 

More than 900g of heroin and 5g of Ice, worth about S$66,000, were seized, the agency added. That amount of heroin can feed the addiction of about 440 abusers for a week, CNB noted. 

One of the suspects, a 61-year-old man, was arrested around Tampines Street 22 on Wednesday morning. Seventeen packets of heroin and a straw of the drug were recovered from him, said CNB.

The man was later taken to his home in Choa Chu Kang, where a further 6g of heroin was seized.

In a follow-up operation that morning, officers raided a residential unit near North Bridge Road, where three men aged between 63 and 65 were arrested, along with a 65-year-old woman. 

CNB said its officers found 100 packets and 10 straws containing about 790g of heroin, as well as a packet containing about 5g of Ice.

Packets of heroin were recovered from a toilet bowl in the unit as well as a nearby rubbish chute, the agency added.

Investigations into the drug activities of all the suspects are ongoing.
