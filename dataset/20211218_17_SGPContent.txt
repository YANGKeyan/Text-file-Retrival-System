“Preliminary investigation into the cause of the fire indicates that it was due to a dropped light from a lit candle left unattended,” it said in a Facebook post.

“SCDF would like to remind members of the public never to leave lighted materials unattended, and to completely extinguish such materials before disposing them into rubbish chutes or bins.”
