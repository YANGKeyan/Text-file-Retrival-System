SINGAPORE: Singapore reported 559 new COVID-19 cases and six fatalities as of noon on Saturday (Dec 11).

The weekly infection growth rate rose to 0.62 from Friday's 0.56. This refers to the ratio of community cases for the past week over the week before.

The growth rate has remained below 1 since Nov 13. A figure below 1 means that the number of new weekly COVID-19 cases is falling.

A total of 538 are locally transmitted cases, comprising 532 in the community and six in migrant workers' dormitories.
